## Hello this is Piotr!

I am an AI fullstack python software developer intersted in an internship for Summer 2025 at FAANG.

My experience is vast in the realm of artificial intelegence. ChatGPT blew my mind from the first time I utilized it to write my essays in high school on my behalf. Since then, I have delved into AI tooling such as Numpy, Pandas, and PyTorch.

Currently, I am a bored member at ACM AI and I love super smash bros. I main IsabelleðŸ˜Ž. Check out my Xeets on X.
